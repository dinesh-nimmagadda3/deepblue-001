## ‚ú® Features

-   **AI-Powered Image Transformation**: Utilizes Google's Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-image`) to intelligently edit and enhance food photos.
-   **Two Transformation Modes: Reimagine & Polish**:
    -   **Reimagine**: Creates a completely new, professional scene. The AI rethinks the plating, utensils, and setting to be authentic and contextual to the dish.
    -   **Polish**: Re-plates your dish in a clean, minimalist style. The AI places the food on a pristine white ceramic plate within a bright studio setting, improving the composition and lighting for a sharp, appetizing, photorealistic look.
-   **Enlarge Image View**: Click on the generated AI photo to view it in a full-screen modal, perfect for appreciating the details.
-   **Download Generated Image**: Easily save the high-quality, AI-generated photo to your device with a single click.
-   **Simple File Upload**: Upload your food images (JPEG, PNG, WebP) from your device with a simple, clickable interface.
-   **Contextual Prompts**: Add a text label (e.g., "Spaghetti Bolognese") to give the AI more context for better, more accurate results.
-   **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Instantly compare your original photo with the professionally generated image.
-   **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern, and fully responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS that works beautifully on all devices.
-   **Loading & Error States**: Clear feedback for users during image processing and for any potential errors.

## üöÄ How It Works

This application is a single-page web app built with modern frontend technologies.

1.  **Image Upload**: The user selects a food photo from their computer. The app reads the file and displays it as a preview.
2.  **Choose a Mode**: The user selects one of two modes:
    -   **Reimagine**: For creating a brand-new professional composition.
    -   **Polish**: For re-plating the dish in a clean, minimalist studio style.
3.  **AI Prompting**: The user can optionally provide a text label for the food. When the "Make it Professional" button is clicked, the app sends the image data and a carefully crafted text prompt (specific to the chosen mode) to the Gemini API.
4.  **Gemini API Call**: The `gemini-2.5-flash-image` model processes the input image and text. Based on the selected mode, the AI will either completely reimagine the scene or re-plate the dish in a minimalist studio style for a clean, professional look.
5.  **Display & Interact**: The API returns the newly generated image, which is then displayed alongside the original. The user can click to enlarge the new image or download it directly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **AI Model**: [Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-image`)](https://ai.google.dev/) via `@google/genai` SDK
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **Bundling/Environment**: The app is designed to run in an environment where `esbuild` or a similar tool handles module resolution, as seen in `index.html`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Running

To run this project, you need to have an environment that can serve the static files and provide the necessary API key.

1.  **Clone the repository** (or have the project files).
2.  **Set up your API Key**: The application requires a Google Gemini API key. This key must be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

    ```
    # In your environment setup (e.g., .env file or server configuration)
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

3.  **Serve the files**: Use a simple local server to host the `index.html` and its associated JavaScript/TypeScript files.

##  usage

1.  Open the application in your web browser.
2.  Click the **"Upload Food Photo"** button or the placeholder card and select an image file from your device.
3.  Your uploaded image will appear in the "Original Food Photo" card.
