    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    company VARCHAR(100),
    
    -- Simple pipeline tracking
    stage VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'lead', -- lead, prospect, customer
    notes TEXT,
    
    -- AI-generated content (stored as text for simplicity)
    ai_summary TEXT, -- AI-generated customer summary
    ai_insights TEXT, -- AI-generated insights
    
    -- Basic tracking
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_contact TIMESTAMP
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE interactions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
    
    -- Interaction details
